  <h2>Instructions</h2>  
    
  <ol>
    <li>Cut chicken in 1/2 inch square pieces. In a large sauté pan, heat olive oil over medium-high heat. Add in cubed chicken to the pan and cook over medium high heat for 12-15 minutes until completely browned and cooked!</li>
    <li>While noodles/chicken are cooking, whisk together the sauce ingredients + set off to the side. Chop vegetables.</li>
    <li>Once chicken has cooked, remove chicken from the pan + set aside in a large bowl. Try to leave the oil in the pan.</li>
    <li>Add in peppers, carrots, garlic and onion to the oil and sauté uncovered for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, stir in bean sprouts and cook for an additional 2 minutes.</li>
    <li>While the vegetables cook, bring a small pot of water to a boil + cook rice noodles according to the directions on the package.</li>
    <li>Push vegetables to one side of the pan + crack eggs into the pan. Scramble eggs until cooked, approximately 2 minutes.</li>
    <li>Stir veggie / egg mixture together. Remove from the pan and set aside with the chicken.</li>
    <li>Add the sauce mixture to the empty pan (you do not need to clean the pan!) and bring to a boil for 1 minute, stirring constantly. The sauce should bubble and slightly thicken.</li>
    <li>Add cooked veggies, cooked chicken and cooked noodles into the pan with the sauce and toss to combine.</li>
    <li>Garnish with peanuts. Optional garnish: lime, cilantro, green onions.</li>
  </ol>
