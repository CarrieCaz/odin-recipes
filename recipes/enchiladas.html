      <h1>Crock Pot Chicken Enchiladas</h1>
      <a> <strong>Chicken Enchiladas</strong> are one of my favorite things to make and eat, so naturally, this slow-cooker version hit it out of the park! I adapted it from this <strong>chicken enchilada skillet recipe</strong>, using boneless, skinless chicken thighs, but you can also use chicken breast. I served it over cilantro lime rice and topped it with avocado and some crema. It was a hit with my family and so easy to make.</a>
      
      <h2>Chicken Enchilada Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Chicken</strong>: Use one pound of boneless, skinless chicken thighs or breasts.</li>
        <li><strong>Onion and Garlic</strong>: Chop half of a medium onion and two garlic cloves.</li>
        <li><strong>Seasoning</strong>: Ground cumin, kosher salt</li>
        <li><strong>Enchilada Sauce</strong>: I prefer making homemade enchilada sauce, but you can also buy it at the supermarket.</li>
        <li><strong>Cream</strong>: All you need is a quarter cup of sour cream for a little creaminess.</li>
        <li><strong>Corn Tortillas</strong>: Cut four tortillas into strips.</li>
        <li><strong>Black Beans</strong>: Rinse and drain one can of low-sodium black beans.</li>
        <li><strong>Cheese</strong>: Buy a Mexican cheese blend, Monterey Jack, or mozzarella.</li>
        <li><strong>Garnishes</strong>: Sliced jalapeños and chopped fresh cilantro</li>
        <li><strong>Optional Toppings</strong>: Sliced avocado, cilantro lime rice, sour cream or crema (Crema generally contains sour cream, lime juice, and salt. I have recipes for roasted poblano crema and avocado crema if you want to try one.) </li></ul>
      
        <h2>How To Make Crock Pot Chicken Enchiladas</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong> Onion and Garlic</strong>: I always saute onions and garlic before adding to the slow cooker for the best results. Start by heating the oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the onion, garlic, cumin, and salt, and sauté while stirring until the onion has softened and browned.</li>
        <li><strong>Put Ingredients in Slow Cooker</strong>: Transfer the cooked onions and garlic to the slow cooker and pour in the enchilada sauce, sour cream, and a quarter cup of water. Stir everything to combine and fold in the beans until thoroughly coated. Nestle the chicken into the sauce.</li>
        <li><strong>Slow Cook</strong>: Cover the crockpot and cook on high for 3 to 4 hours or low for 6 to 7 hours, until the chicken is tender and shreds easily. Shred the chicken right in the pot with two forks.</li>
        <li><strong>Tortillas And Cheese</strong>: Stir in the tortilla strips and top with cheese. Cover the slow cooker and cook for about 30 minutes until the cheese has melted.</li>
        <li><strong>How To Serve</strong>: Spoon a cup of the enchilada casserole into your bowl and garnish with cilantro and jalapeños. You can also serve it over rice with sliced avocado and more sour cream or crema.</li>
